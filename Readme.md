# ConTeXt Language Server

A Language Server for the ConTeXt typesetting system.

Other than providing a TextMateGrammar for direct use by the [VSCode syntax
highlighting](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/syntax-highlight-guide),
this [LanguageServer](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/)
provides:

- an overview of a ConTeXt's document structure (eventually across all files in
  the document),

- (eventually) links to all references (both where they are defined and where
  they are used),

- ....
